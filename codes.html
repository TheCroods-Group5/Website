           Online games have been and will continue to be one of the most popular hobbies for teens due to
           how accessible they are at current times. It provides stimulation that is great for entertainment and
           satisfaction to people of all ages. Moreover, they are designed to be addictive using state-of-the-art behavioral
           psychology to keep you hooked. But the same with other sports, it also has its own disadvantages. With this, as students and
           individuals who value health, digging deeper into the causes and effects of online gaming addiction would teach a variety of
           people to take appropriate action.

        <b>NEED OF VIEWERS</b>
            <br>Online Gaming may appear to be good for building up character development, but the lack of self-limitation of teenage students to this is closely linked to online gaming addiction, greatly affecting our well-being, whether socially, mentally, physically, or emotionally.

            <br>- Know how online gaming addiction affects the overall health of a player.
            <br>- Manage their time when playing online games to avoid addiction.
            <br>- Analyze what online games are appropriate for their age.
            <br>- Learn ways how to overcome online gaming addiction.

         <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-left-align">
           It has been a challenging ride working toward the finish line for Group 5.
           However, our becoming one by helping one another enabled us to manage and reach the end of quarter 1 together.
           The process of how we found the need for streaming was kind of easy as the subject's Experience Guides and the ideas of
           our members served an important role in achieving our goal. Though it may be easy to understand, it was hard to properly
           execute. We have focused on 3 certain content types which are Educational Videos, Community Based Videos, and Video Podcasts.
           Forming these three choices were based on what content type and platform would best suit our topic, online gaming addiction.
           In order to dig deeper on its viewers, audience demographics were required so we released a survey. Releasing a survey was one
           of the most exciting part for our group as it gives us the chance to communicate and understand viewers of a certain content type
           more, a crucial step toward finding the need for streaming. As a result, we are proud of the work we have done and will continue to
           work hard and do our best in the upcoming tasks assigned to us, Group 5 members.
